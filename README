Nagios Plug-in for iLO RESTful Extension
------------------------------------------
Nagios plug-in for HPE iLO RESTful Extension aims to automatically manage HPE
ProLiant servers within the data center. With the help of the plug-in,
the administator does not need to configure the nagios configuration file
(/nagios_etc_path/conf.d) manually. The plug-in automatically writes the
server configuration to the nagios configuration file
(/nagios_etc_path/cfg_dir/ilo.cfg, for example:
/usr/local/nagios/etc/ilo/ilo.cfg under Ubuntu 14.04)
once any of HPE ProLiant servers is discovered within the data center.

Requirements:
-------------
SW:
- curl,libcurl,libtdb,snmptrapd,python
HW:
- HPE ProLiant Server

Features:
-------------
1) Discover and monitor HPE ProLiant servers within data center automatically.
There are two alternatives to discover HPE ProLiant servers.

	1.1) Active discovery: The active discovery scans all available servers
			       in the network of the monitoring server. This
			       approach can discovery all up and running servers
			       with the data center. Note that this feature
			       is a time-consuming process if your data center
			       has lots of hosts/IP addresses to be discovered.

	1.2) Passive discovery: The passive discovery discovers HPE ProLiant
				servers once receiving the cold start traps
				generated by those servers. The traps are
				generated when those servers get booted
				successfully, so this approach cannot discover
				the up and running servers within the data
				center.

2) Provide the high-level server status.

3) Display the server status in real-time if the status is changed.

4) Categorize the preferred servers into the same host group,
and the preferred services into the same services group.
